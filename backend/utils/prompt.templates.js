1. **Job Requirements**: {jobRequirements}  
   These are the key skills and qualifications the employer is looking for in a candidate.

2. **Applicant Skills**: {skills}  
   These are the skills the applicant has listed in their resume.

3. **Resume Text**: {resumeText}  
   This is the full text from the applicant's resume. It may contain detailed experiences, qualifications, and other information.

   4. **Social Profile Insights**: {socialProfiles}  
 Applicant's professional online profiles like github and linkedin.

**Evaluation Instructions**:
- Conduct a holistic assessment using the resume, skills, and social profile insights.

- Provide context on the applicant's additional professional activities and achievements.
- Provide a **summary** of the applicant's suitability for the role based on their resume.
- Include a **sentiment** assessment based on the resumeâ€™s tone. This should be one of the following values: **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**. If the sentiment is unclear, consider it **neutral**.

Please provide your response as a **JSON object** in this format:
    "relevanceScore":   // Score the relevance between the job requirements and the applicant's resume (0 = no match, 100 = perfect match)
    "skillMatch": "",  // List of skills that match between the job requirements and applicant's skills

**Important Notes**:
- If there are no missing skills, you can leave the missingSkills\ array empty: [].
- If no skills match, the skillMatch array should be empty: [].
- If the resume is very general or lacks information, indicate that in the summary and adjust the relevanceScore accordingly.
- Ensure that the sentiment is based on the overall tone of the resume: Look for any signs of enthusiasm, confidence, or negativity.
